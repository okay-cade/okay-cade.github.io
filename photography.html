      <h4>Illustria Stock Photography</h4>
      <p>In Illustria’s first few years, we had been using only stock images in all materials — not the most ideal situation. With a website redesign underway, it was about time we had a library of our own custom images! However, our budget was $0. Luckily for Illustria, the designers are resourceful. A small team of us came up with enough equipment and props to set up a shoot in our make-shift studio — formerly a conference room. We styled the entire room and worked with a handful of coworkers turned models to create genuine, bright, and humble images.</p>
      <p>While keeping the overall brand vision in mind, we also knew that these photos would eventually become one of our largest pool of assets for the new website. Therefore, we focused on shooting flat, bright images with plenty of negative space for web copy and CTAs.</p>
      <p>There are challenges that come up with resourceful photoshoots — the toughest being our team of sweet, camera shy designers-turned-models. In order to combat the general awkwardness in these photoshoots, we kept the atmosphere light, told bad jokes in front of and behind the camera, and encouraged the models to act as they normally would throughout the day.</p>

      <h4>Illustria Portraits</h4>
      <p>In addition to our stock photography, Illustria’s new website required we show our clients the management team’s pretty faces. The dilemma with this was management wanted serious, business-professional-like portraits since a portion of Illustria’s clientele are B2B companies. However, we brought up how “serious” portraits would be completely against our already established “friendly, approachable, empathetic” brand persona/voice. The pleasant compromise we came to was to have everyone’s portraits show up as serious by default, but upon hovering and while reading their bio a genuine, happy alternative would appear. While simultaneously photographing everyone’s “boss face” we coaxed real moments of each model's personality for the final series.</p>

      <h4>For Funsies</h4>
      <p>I love to carry my small camera whenever I feel confident I won’t accidentally drop it or get caught in a storm. My personal photography tends to favor candidness over planned shots, and I feel as though I learn more about shooting in different conditions every day. Getting from point A of “I see a beautiful composition; I have to photograph it!” to point B of an interesting, well lit/composed/edited photo is a constant learning experience. It is wonderful to look through past photographs and not only see my overall photography style progress and develop (ha), but I also a visual timeline of my life!</p>
