      <h4>Illustria Stock Photography</h4>
      <p>In Illustria’s first few years, we had been using only stock images in all materials — not the most ideal situation. With a website redesign underway, it was about time we had a library of our own custom images! However, our budget was $0. Luckily for Illustria, the designers are resourceful. A small team of us came up with enough equipment and props to set up a shoot in our make-shift studio — formerly a conference room. We styled the entire room and worked with a handful of coworkers turned models to create genuine, bright, and humble images.</p>
      <p>While keeping the overall brand vision in mind, we also knew that these photos would eventually become one of our largest pool of assets for the new website. Therefore, we focused on shooting flat, bright images with plenty of negative space for web copy and CTAs.</p>
      <p>There are challenges that come up with resourceful photoshoots — the toughest being our team of sweet, camera shy designers-turned-models. In order to combat the general awkwardness in these photoshoots, we kept the atmosphere light, told bad jokes in front of and behind the camera, and encouraged the models to act as they normally would throughout the day. </p>

      <h4>Illustria Portraits</h4>
      <p>In addition to stock photography, Illustria’s new website required portraits of our team. The dilemma we faced was combining management’s desire for serious, business-professional images with the friendly and approachable aesthetic we had established for the brand. This led to an interesting compromise — to show both! My role in the process started with setting up lighting and ended with editing every shot to be perfectly consistent. The end result featured uniquely animated portraits that showcased a professional, yet genuine team.</p>

      <h4>For Funsies</h4>
      <p>I love to carry my small single-lens camera whenever I feel confident I won’t accidentally drop it or get caught in a storm. My personal photography tends to favor candidness over planned shots, and I feel as though I learn more about shooting in different conditions every day. Getting from point A of “I see a beautiful composition; I have to photograph it!” to point B of an interesting, well lit/composed/edited photo is a constant learning experience. It is wonderful to look through past photographs and not only see my overall photography style progress and develop (ha), but I also a visual timeline of my life!</p>
