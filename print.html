      <h4>Pup Portraits</h4>
      <p>An on-going series, my canine friends have been a great opportunity to push my illustration style and play with visual balance  and hierarchy. These 2 to 3 layer block prints all start out as grayscale digital sketches and come to life once carved and printed in varying color schemes.</p>
      <p>Carving my vector-style illustrations onto printing blocks always proves challenging; however, once finished I appreciate the additional personality of the imperfect, hand-made lines.</p>
      <p>With the number of pup prints soon running into the thousands, I have had a lot of time to play with color schemes! Originally, I felt as though my small ink collection of red, yellow, blue, white, and black was very limiting. After a few rounds of mixing I found that creating new colors and color combinations was half that fun!</p>
