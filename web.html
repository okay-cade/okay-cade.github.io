      <h4>Illustria Portfolio Pages</h4>
      <p>LTo showcase Illustria’s best projects, I worked as Senior Designer with a team of 3 web designers and our Art Director to create the portfolio section of our company. These pages were essential to the new front end design, as they were to be the primary driver of sales for the company. As a team, we created a consistent method displaying projects – across different clients, different industries, and even different mediums. We used uniform layouts and mockup to display each project in a self-contained, full page collage. As as part of the Illustria front end design, my role of Asset Manager applied on all portfolio pages as well – from organization to optimization.</p>
