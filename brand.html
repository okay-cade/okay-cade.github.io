      <h4>Illustria's Brand</h4>
      <p>As Senior Designer for all internal Illustria projects, I worked closely with the internal Art Director to develop and continue Illustria’s brand. A small team had already developed a logo, typeface, and rough color scheme. But in implementing these elements into everything we designed, I learned that the expansion of a brand goes so far beyond those initial assets, and that consistency of visual identity over time maintains the company’s personality. In my role as Senior Designer, I worked with our talented team of designers to assure each brand project fit together cohesively — from internal materials, to sales and marketing, to social media. Additionally, large scale projects always passed through my hands for a final quality assurance to guarantee that we didn’t let any silly production mistake slip through to the press or our clients.</p>
      <p>After a year of working with initial brand assets and additional exploration, Illustria’s Brand Art Director and I received budget approval to construct an extremely thorough and expansive brand manual. We pushed for this initiative as a plan to save us time in the long run, maintain consistency across our visual identity, and introduce sales, design, and management teams to how the Illustria vision and voice should be carried out across mediums in the future.
