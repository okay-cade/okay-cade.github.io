      <h4>MediaMath InDesign Templates</h4>
      <p>MediaMath is a big-data company with multiple sub brands, each with their own distinct look and feel. In the past, MediaMath had hired Illustria to design dozens of whitepapers from scratch, but realized this was not the most scalable process. Instead, I offered the idea of creating an InDesign template for MediaMath’s in-house designers to work from and easily plug in new copy and graphics. The client loved the idea, and supplied an existing PDF for each brand that I could use as a guide in creating the templates.</p>
<p>With the variety of content MediaMath uses in its whitepapers, I created numerous type styles, paragraph styles, swatches, graphic treatments, and layout guides for every situation imaginable (and then some). I also included multiple pages of placeholder copy and graphics on mock layouts, in order to clearly communicate to future designers how each brand should be treated.</p>

      <h4>Lotame eBook Graphics</h4>
      <p>Let’s be honest, an ebook about data management platforms is not the most interesting subject matter in the world. Thats where I come in —  to add the design flair and reader flow that keeps people engaged. In collaboration with Lotame’s copywriters, I created numerous graphs and illustrations to better communicate some of the data-heavy topics while tying in the themes of sports and teamwork present in the overall brand campaign. By breaking down information into understandable graphics, I was able to increase Lotame’s reader engagement and elevate their ebook library.</p>

      <h4>PENSCO White Papers</h4>
      <p>PENSCO is a trust company that values transparency with the goal of educating their users on finances and benefits. This means lots and lots of ebooks. PENSCO had an established template in InDesign, coming to me with requests for numerous iterations of PDFs. My job was to flow copy and assets into pre-designed layouts, ensuring that all type was properly styled, formatted, and ragged. On a small scale, say a PDF or two, this isn’t such a daunting task. However, dozens? Any accidental typo could send the reader in the absolute wrong direction! To combat this, I gave each line of text individual attention, even finding a couple misspellings that had slipped though.</p>

      <h4>Zozi Infographic</h4>
      <p>Armed with only a Microsoft Word document containing a few abstract statistics, I aimed to present this information in one long form infographic that Zozi planned to release in a blog and email campaign. The additional guidelines of this project included working within the 6 shades of Zozi’s color palette while simultaneously further developing their illustration style. Since my natural illustration style is very vector-heavy, that proved to be no problem! This initial  infographic got such a good response, that it inspired Zozi to continue the campaign by creating additional graphics on new topics, within the same illustration style and layout.</p>
