      <h4>Illustria Band Iconography</h4>
      <p>Illustria’s brand voice is genuine, inviting, and fun. To add some personality to their visual style of bold angles and saturated color, I developed an entire style of icons to be used as additional visuals to support copy. Illustria kicks out a huge amount of documents with a wide range of copy, so these icons are applicable across both print and web applications of design and marketing materials. In addition to the icons themselves, I established icon guidelines for future designers to continue the collection as the brand’s needs grow.</p>
        <p>The largest challenge with this project was with brainstorming universally understood visuals that would clearly represent some of the more abstract concepts that Illustria speaks of throughout their brand voice. Examples of some of these challenging phrases I conquered include “give and receive constant feedback,” “build strong foundations,” “empower others through design,” and many more. In the end these concepts led to some pretty unique icons!</p>

      <h4>Naturvention Web Iconography</h4>
      <p>Naturvention approached Illustria needing an icon set for their new website after seeing the icons I had done for Illustria’s own brand (aww thanks!) Naturvention’s product is essentially a cool-looking wall of self-watering plants, so I used the plant leaf to visually represent their company and product whenever possible. I faced similar challenges here as I did with Illustria’s icons — illustrating universally understood icons for abstract concepts. Only this time they were even more conceptual. Some of the challenging copy included “ Restored Wellness,” “ Seamless Install,” and “ Increased Productivity.” After many, many sketches, failed ideas, and asking every person in my office “does this icon make sense to you?” I had a cohesive set that Naturvention loved!</p>
